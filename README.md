# MyAgencyMap
During my first internship at WinTravel i was able to develop a small lighweight web app  . 

This web application is designed to provide the agency employees  with an interactive map where they can explore various agency locations with their informations . it consumes data provided from excel sheets using spredsheetDB free API . It also uses Leaflet.js for mapping and features dynamic search, filtering, and interactive marker display .
